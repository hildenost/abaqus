# abaqus-kate-syntax
Abaqus input file syntax highlighting settings for Kate text editor

## How to use
1. Put `abaqus.xml` in path `~/.local/share/katepart5/syntax/` (KDE5-path, other versions might have a different path)
2. (Re)start Kate
3. The highlighting file automatically assumes `.inp`-extensions is an ABAQUS input file, but to set syntax highlighting of file manually, you'll find the option **abaqus** in the **Scientific** category.
